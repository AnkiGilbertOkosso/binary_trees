# Binary Trees Project 
---

This README reflects the essence of the Binary Trees Project while focusing on the knowledge and skills I gained during its completion. This project is part of the 0x1D. C - Binary trees curriculum, aimed at improving our understanding of binary trees, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Let's delve into what I've learned:

## Exploring Binary Trees

Through this project, I dived deep into the world of binary trees. I grasped the following key concepts:

### Binary Trees

I now understand the fundamental characteristics of binary trees, which are hierarchical data structures comprising nodes with parent-child relationships. These relationships form a branching structure that is essential for various applications.

### Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree

I learned to differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST). Binary trees have no specific ordering rules, while BSTs maintain a specific order where left child nodes are smaller than their parent, and right child nodes are greater.

### Time Complexity

One crucial aspect I grasped is the potential time complexity benefits of binary trees compared to linked lists. Binary trees offer efficient operations like searching, insertion, and deletion, making them valuable data structures for specific use cases.

### Depth, Height, and Size

I can now calculate the depth, height, and size of a binary tree. Depth is the level of a node from the root, height is the maximum depth, and size is the total number of nodes in the tree.

### Traversal Methods

I have acquired knowledge about various methods to traverse a binary tree, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals. These methods are essential for accessing and processing tree nodes in a specific order.

### Types of Binary Trees

I can recognize and understand different types of binary trees, such as complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees. Each type has unique characteristics and applications.

## Project Requirements

In addition to gaining knowledge about binary trees, this project introduced me to crucial software development practices:

- **Editor Choice:** I can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs for code development.
- **Compilation Skills:** I learned how to compile code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options to ensure code quality.
- **File Formatting:** I adopted the practice of ensuring all my code files end with a new line.
- **Coding Style:** I applied the Betty style, which helps maintain clean and readable code. My code was checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables:** I learned to avoid the use of global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and maintenance challenges.
- **Modular Code:** I organized my code efficiently, limiting the number of functions in each file to no more than 5.
- **Standard Library Usage:** I became proficient in utilizing the standard library for various programming tasks.
- **Header File Creation:** I created a header file named `binary_trees.h` to store function prototypes for my project.
- **Include Guards:** I understand the importance of using include guards in header files to prevent multiple inclusions.
- **GitHub Best Practices:** I now appreciate the importance of managing project repositories on GitHub and adhering to best practices.

## Conclusion

This Binary Trees Project was a valuable learning experience, enhancing my understanding of binary trees and reinforcing good programming practices. I am now well-equipped to apply this knowledge in future projects and continue my journey as a skilled software developer.
